[1]Visibility
  - Tools that allow us to see and react when failures occurs, such as
    monitors, alerts, metrics, dashboard, etc.
    - Log Streams = Centralized log service.
    
    - Instrumentation(Network & Transaction Traceability)
    
    - Metrics (Compute, Network, Storage, App)
    

[2]Survive
  - Promote fault tolerance + Environment Agnostic:
    - Circuit Breaker.

    - Dynamic filters.

    - Environment Provisioning

    - Fast Startup

[3]Maintain
   - Configuration Service
   - API Managmente/Api first
     - API Maturity model:
       - Level 0: HTTP is used as a transport system for remote interactions.
       	       	  no Real APIs are supported.
	 Level 1: Published and authenticated, Apis documented.
	 Level 2: HTTP + verbs
	 Level 3: HateOAS + Status code.
	 Level 4: metrics collected
	 Level 5: 100% compliance
   - microservices
   - Decomposing Data

[4]Adapt
   - Every monkeys/ Simian Army.

[5] Extensible
